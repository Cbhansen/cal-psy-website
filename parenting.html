                Being a parent isn't easy. We've all seen a child throwing a tantrum in a store when they don't get the toy or candy that they 
                wanted, but a crucial aspect of that event is how the parent reacts based on their parenting style. Parenting styles have profound
                effects on a child's development, and even though we've seen all types of parenting, there are four main styles that produce 
                different outcomes. Diana Baumrind, one of the most revered psychologists involved with parenting style research,  identified three 
                parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive.  About two decades later in 1983, Maccoby and Martin further 
                developed the model by differentiating the permissive parenting style into indulgent permissive and neglectful parenting and 
                basing the four styles on variations in demandingness and responsiveness.
                <br><br>
                What type of parenting style did your parents have? Were they strict? Did they let you be out late at night? 
                Or did you have an early curfew? The following is an explanation of the four main parenting styles  to help you understand 
                which parenting style is great for raising a happy, well-behaved, and high-achieving child.

                        Authoritative parenting styles are considered to by the most beneficial and effective style for children based on 
                        extensive research. This style is high on both demandingness and responsiveness. <a target="_blank" href=
                        "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0272431691111004">Baumrind</a> would describe these 
                        parents as imparting clear standards for their children's conduct. They are assertive, but not intrusive and 
                        restrictive" (Baumrind p. 62). Parents are not motivated by an external unquestionable standard as authoritarian 
                        parents are, instead they think about their child's individual needs and recognize that their isn't just one rule 
                        of all. They set in place a certain rule structure, but allow choice within it. For example, they may set a rule 
                        structure that requires their child to wear clothes, but they allow them to wear anything they'd like. Even though 
                        they present themselves as authority figures, they are also warm, caring, and responsive to their child's needs. 
                        Instead of providing only punishment, they often times also discuss the reasons for punishment to help improve their 
                        child's behavior in future. An emphasis is placed on open communication rather than absolute rule of law.

                        Authoritarian parenting errs on the stricter side of parenting, involving rigid and demanding parenting.
                        According to <a target="_blank" href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0272431691111004">Baumrind</a>, she describes these types of parents as "obedience- and status-oriented, and expect 
                        their orders to be obeyed without explanation" (Baumrind 1991 p. 62). With respect to the first dimension of 
                        parenting styles, they are low on the responsive scale by providing less affection, praise, and attention to 
                        their child's individual needs. They also don't allow much negotiation or choice within the strict rule structure
                        at is set in place. When their children are commit wrongdoing, they tend to punish their children by not displaying 
                        affection. With the second dimension of parenting styles, they are very high on demandingness since expect their 
                        rules to be followed without question; one could think of a drill sergeant as a model of what they'd be like.
