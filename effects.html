                    Children raised by authoritative parents emerge as more independent, self-controlled, and adventurous, because 
                    these parents set standards and limits for their children and explain why they discipline their children. These 
                    rules and explanations develop these children’s senses and adaptations to social cues 
                    (Lightfoot, Cole, &amp; Cole, 2013, p. 349). Children nurtured by authoritative parents score than other children 
                    raised by authoritarian, permissive, or neglectful (uninvolved) parents in measures of competence, 
                    social development, self-esteem, and mental health. This correlates with how authoritative parents facilitate 
                    moderate levels of family acceptance, supervision, and control.

                        <li>With parental warmth, acceptance, and involvement, a study by Gray and Steinberg (1999) exhibited that this 
                            negatively correlated with externalizing behavior (such as physical aggression, disobedience, destruction of 
                            property) and other problematic behaviors.</li>
                        <li>In other words, balanced levels of supervision and monitoring correlates with reduced aggression and behavioral problems such as cheating, copying homework, and being tarty.</li>
                        <li>More likely to develop better self-regulation over their emotions and behaviors.</li>

                        <li>More likely to develop better social competence, self-reliance, and maturity (Steinberg, Elmen, & Mounts, 1989).</li>

                    <p>
                        Children tended by authoritarian parents seem to lack social competence, withdrawing from social contact and 
                        social interaction. They often lack spontaneity and intellectual curiosity (Lightfoot, Cole, &amp; Cole, 2013, 
                        p. 349). Authoritarian parents shape and control their children with an absolute set of standards, emphasizing 
                        obedience, respect for authority, and tradition.

                <ul>
                    <li>Because these parents aren’t involved with their children’s academic success, such as caring for their grades or helping with their homework, these children are less likely to

                <div class="panel animated fadeIn">
                Because neglectful parents lack supervision, control, and responsiveness over their children, these children have to 
                learn to provide for themselves, fearing becoming dependent on others. They become emotionally withdrawn and exhibit 
                more delinquent behaviors, especially an increased risk of substance abuse. They feel more fear, anxiety, and stress 
                due to lack of family support. These are the children who report the worst outcomes in terms of behavioral development, 
                psychosocial development, and academic success.
