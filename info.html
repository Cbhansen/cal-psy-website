            <h3>Just Tips, no Tricks</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding parenting styles and their effects on a child is very important. However, putting the information into
                practice is the next step. Being mindful of your parenting practices will allow your child to grow up in a good 
                environment. Developing your parental sensitivity—the parent’s ability to understand and respond to their child—is of 
                utmost importance in developing a good parenting style.  The following will help guide you to developing good parenting 
                traits and habits.

                <button class="btn accordion">Understand your baby</button>
                <div class="panel animated fadeIn" style="display: block">
                    <p>
                        Read your baby's cues accurately. This includes understanding when your baby is hurt or frightened. Additionally,
                        a parents should be able to identify their child’s habits. Being able to report in detail about your child’s 
                        needs is a good check that you are understanding your baby. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="btn accordion">Respond accurately and quickly</button>
                <div class="panel animated flipInX">
                    <p>
                        Response to a child’s needs is of utmost importance. When responding to your child, ensure that you are reacting 
                        appropriately and promptly. An appropriate response will rely on your ability to understand your child’s habits,
                        as explained previously. The effectiveness of a response also relies on minimizing the time it takes to address 
                        your child. Both these factors should not be overlooked when being a mindful parent.

                <button class="btn accordion">You don’t have to spoil</button>
                <div class="panel animated flipInX">
                    <p>
                        Remember, responding to your child doesn’t mean you must give them what they want. Spoiling your child is not 
                        ideal either. Simply put, be present with your child and provide them comfort. If you disagree with what your 
                        child wants, talk to them and let them understand that they can’t have what they want. Do so in a meaningful way.

                        Enjoy interacting with your baby! When the feeling to be there for your child is genuine, parenting will feel that 
                        much more rewarding. On top of that, these parenting tips will become even easier to accomplish.

                        For some kids, parenting style has a direct link to their exploration activity for their careers. 
                        Children under an authoritative parent, in general, had an increased curiosity about their future. Furthermore, 
                        the authoritatively raised children had higher satisfaction in their future careers. Some discrepancies between the sex of the 
                        child yield different results. Despite this, an authoritative parenting style posed no negative traits on the children as a whole.

                        Studies have shown that parenting interventions around the child’s age of 36 months were successful in increasing parental 
                        sensitivity. This means with a little bit of help, you could improve your parenting and understanding of your child. These 
                        interventions were of many forms including one-to-one help, group work, or self-guided instructions. However, the earlier you 
                        start the intervention, the more effective your methods will be, so it’s best not to hold it off. Seek professional help if it 
                        feels too overwhelming. Many different methods of interventions can be conducted that fit your comfort level. It’s very important 
                        to note, however, the parent must act as the agent of change for any change to happen. Remember, your baby isn’t going to dial 
                        the phone asking for help, that’s up to the parent!
