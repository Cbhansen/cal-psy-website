            <p>Misconceptions are views and opinions that are incorrect because they are based on faulty thinking or understanding. 
            Often times we tend to believe what we hear without questioning and will base our views and opinions solely on this. 
            These misconceptions often lead parents to avoid healthy authoritative parenting styles for fear that their children will 
            become disobedient or rebellious if given a balance between options and responsibility. Here are some common parenting style
            misconceptions:

                        <strong>Myth: "Spare the rod, spoil the child"</strong><br>
                        The saying “spare the rod, spoil the child” is an antiquated phrase that means if a parent does not discipline their child by hitting them 
                        (with a rod or wooden stick), then that child will become spoiled. 
                        On the contrary, research has shown that child abuse can lead to developmental problems such as mental health issues. A considerable
                         amount of research on the topic has also shown that spanking predicts increased levels of aggression in children. Furthermore, 
                         research has shown that children tend to imitate aggressive acts as seen in observational analysis such as 
                         Albert Bandura's Bobo Doll study <strong>(Bandura)</strong>.

                        It is important to note that there is a difference between spanking and corporal punishment and/or child abuse. 
                        Certain factors also seem to play a role in how children who are spanked will develop later in life. One of the most 
                        important of these factors is the quality of parenting that is given. For example, children who experience positive 
                        parenting such as positive displays of affection, emotional support, and positive verbal encouragement tend not to be 
                        as affected by spanking as opposed to children who are raised in more harsh environments. (McKee et al.; 2007) 
                        However, although research has shown different and often opposite outcomes on the effects of spanking, the most 
                        important thing to remember is that child abuse can have extremely detrimental affects on children.

                        Many parents believe that they should not give their children a choice when deciding on simple tasks.
                        This is not the case. It is important to give your children options because as a result they will have the 
                        opportunity to learn how to negotiate, become self-reliant, develop self-discipline, develop social skills, 
                        and increased self-esteem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If children are not provided with these opportunities, they may build resentment which can lead to behavior problems and 
                        increase the odds of delinquency and even drug use later on. Remember it is important to keep a healthy balance; parents 
                        should be flexible and willing to reason with their children when necessary. <strong>(Rudy and Grusec, 2001)</strong>

                        <strong>Myth: Parents shouldn’t tell their kids “no”</strong><br>
                        Authoritarian parenting errs on the stricter side of parenting, involving rigid and demanding parenting.
                        According to <a target="_blank" href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0272431691111004">Baumrind</a>, she describes these types of parents as "obedience- and status-oriented, and expect 
                        their orders to be obeyed without explanation" (Baumrind 1991 p. 62). With respect to the first dimension of 
                        parenting styles, they are low on the responsive scale by providing less affection, praise, and attention to 
                        their child's individual needs. They also don't allow much negotiation or choice within the strict rule structure
                        at is set in place. When their children are commit wrongdoing, they tend to punish their children by not displaying 
                        affection. With the second dimension of parenting styles, they are very high on demandingness since expect their 
                        rules to be followed without question; one could think of a drill sergeant as a model of what they'd be like.

                            Bribery is not always the best way to get your child to behave. As mentioned, children need boundaries and limits to
                            learn the proper developmental skills needed early on. Some parents fear that their children will grow to resent 
                            them and so their actions my at times resemble those of a friend rather than a parent. Many parents will use bribery
                            such as toys, gifts, and food as a means to get a child to behave, but this can have a drawback as children quickly
                            learn they can control a situation when misbehaving in order to get what they want.

                        <strong>Myth: You'll spoil your child if you pick them up when they cry.</strong><br>
                        You cannot spoil an infant. Responding to an infant cry is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinforcement for more crying. Infants use crying as a 
                        form of communication to signal to their caregiver that they have a need. By refusing to soothe a child that is crying, 
                        parents are not teaching independence, but rather will only teach their child anxiety and mistrust. In order for a child 
                        to gain confidence, parents should respond quickly and consistently to the child's needs. Research shows that responding 
                        to your child's needs with consistency and promptness is associated with a decline in the frequency and duration of infant 
                        crying <strong>(Bell and Ainsworth)</strong>. Always respond to a crying infants needs and you should see a gradual decrease in crying from 
                        birth to 12 months. After the child is about 6-12 months, you can pull back a bit and let the child begin to figure out 
                        that they will be fine.

                    <button class="btn accordion">Myth: Children need to learn how to fend for themselves; Children need touph love</button>

                        <p>
                            Parents who believe their children need “tough love” may seldom show warmth towards their children. These parents 
                            can often be cold and non-nurturing because they feel that children should learn to fend for themselves. 
                            Unfortunately, this does not work as you cannot teach a dependent child independence. By being unresponsive to your
                            child's needs, you are only teaching your child anxiety and mistrust. Your child will quickly learn that they 
                            cannot rely on anyone for support when needed. <strong>(Bell and Ainsworth)</strong>
