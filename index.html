                        Raising children is perhaps one of the most difficult and most rewarding jobs in the world. It is also likely the 
                        job for which you might feel the least prepared. <br><br>
                        Our goal is to help individuals learn more about the basics of parenting
                        styles and attachment categories. As well as to inform individuals of common parenting misconceptions and to provide effective 
                        tips and helpful information for parenting that may greatly benefit your child.<br><br>
                        Our hope is that parents, caregivers, friends, and family will leave this website with the proper tools and information needed to provide more effective and healthful parenting. Our mission is to inform individuals of the 
                        importance of parenting styles and how parenting choices can help to shape and affect your child's future for the better.

                    <div class="col-md-8 col-offset-4">
                        Parenting styles are the typical and standard set of techniques that parents and/or guardians use in child rearing. Developmental 
                        psychologists discovered four types of parenting styles: Authoritative, Authoritarian, Permissive, and Neglectful/Uninvolved.
                        <br><br>
                        Researchers have long been interested in how parenting styles might affect child development. Some studies have found that there are 
                        links between parenting styles and the effects that these styles have on children. (Baumrind, 1991; Maccoby & Martin, 1983)
